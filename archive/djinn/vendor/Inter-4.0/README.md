# Dependencies

This folder contains all the third-party dependencies used within Celeritas and are *vendored* into the source.

We of course also rely on various libraries and packages to be installed at the system level

```
glad - opengl function pointer loader
glfw - cross-platform window creation & input handling
stb_image - image loading (PNG, JPG, etc)
stb_truetype - TrueType font loading and bitmap texture baking
Inter - very clean open-source font that is used everywhere
... sqlite coming soon
```
